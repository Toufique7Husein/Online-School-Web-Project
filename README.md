# Online-School
Online school System is a web-based application that tracks current
student’s academic information and manages classes and examinations. It maintains
academic information for ready access by office staff, students, and their faculties.
Instead of tedious paperwork, students will be able to submit required information
electronically, and the departments will be able to evaluate the submissions with a
much quicker turnaround.

# Technologies Used

# User Interfaces:
Users will be greeted by a sign-in page where he/she can either sign-in or create a
new account. If the user successfully enters the login credentials he/she will be taken
to the user dashboard. If the user is new then they must create a new account and
then login if the system administrator grants the access. Once signed in, the user is
greeted to a dashboard. The dashboard will help navigate the user throughout the
entire system where they can add,store and view files in different folders both public
and private.

# Hardware Interfaces:
For the hardware interfaces, as the system is being developed as a web application
and mobile application there are no restrictions to access the web application. It is also expected

mobile app will use it to scan documents.
